DisplayP3ImageView Sample
==========================
A sample to view Display P3 image on Android Device. If Android OS and device supports display P3 mode, two versions of the image will be displayed:
- Display P3 view on the left hand side
- sRGB view on the right hand side

Pre-requisites
--------------
- Android O (API >= 26) device that supports Display P3 mode
- Android Studio 2.3+
- Android [NDK-r15+](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html)

Getting Started
---------------
1. [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
1. [Download Android NDK-r15+](https://github.com/android-ndk/ndk/wiki)
1. [Download source code](http://www.github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk)

Description
-----------
This sample creates Display P3 OpenGL context, create 2 textures
for the each PNG files under "assets": the first is in Display P3 image mode,
the second is in sRGB mode.  The sRGB texture is created by transforming the 
original Display P3 image into CIExyz 1931 color space, clamping colors, then
transforming it back to Display P3 color space to display.

The Display P3 is turned on when application requesting a window surface in
`EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_DISPLAY_P3_EXT`:
```java
  std::vector<EGLint> attributes;
  attributes.push_back(EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_KHR);
  attributes.push_back(EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_DISPLAY_P3_EXT);
  attributes.push_back(EGL_NONE);
  engine->surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(
      engine->display, config, engine->app->window, attributes.data());

```
All images under "assets" are *assumed* to be already encoded in Display P3 color
space:
- gamma value : 2.2
- Display P3 color space with D65 as white reference point

To add new images, simply drop the new file into this folder. 

Changing display mode:
- Tap on image to show/hide (Display P3 mode or sRGB mode)
- Swipe up / down to rotate through image files
